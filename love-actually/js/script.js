- Allow the user to control one of the circles
Anything goes, from clicking to position it, to having it follow the mouse, to using the arrow keys, to something else
- Make the non-user circle move differently
Use random movement or Perlin noise or teleportation or something else!
- Add at least one extra function
Not including functions any built-in p5 functions like keyPressed()
Maybe you could add a function that checks if one circle has grown too large (if they grow) or shrunk too small (if they shrink), or faded too much (if their alpha fades)
- Add at least one extra ending
Maybe it could be an “easter egg” and hard to discover? (Moving the mouse to a really specific location?)
Maybe it offers a different dimension of thinking about love and loss?
Maybe it’s connected to the new function in the previous step?
